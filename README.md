# Artificial Neural Network Training

This Jupyter notebook contains instructions and code for training an artificial neural network. The notebook covers various aspects of the training process, such as:
- Loading and preprocessing data
- Defining the neural network architecture
- Setting hyperparameters
- Implementing training algorithms
- Evaluating the performance of the trained model

Additionally, the notebook includes visualizations of the training process and the results obtained.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Required Libraries (e.g. Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Background
This notebook was created as a task in a Master's degree in Complexity Sciences, where the study of artificial neural networks is used as a tool to analyze complex systems and understand their behavior.
